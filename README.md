# Convert Html to Image in Js
This program in Js allows you to convert an HTML into an image (PNG, JPG, etc).

1. Download project and open it in Visual Code.
2. In the Visual Code terminal, located in the root of the project, type 'npm install', it will install the folder: node_modules
5. 'puppeteer' will also be installed, if it is not installed you must install it, since we use it to carry out the conversion.
